The other one is physical determinations: \nThermometers that measures thermal energy of temperture by electronic \nmeans ordisplacement of mercury. Sethoscopes are instruments that \nmonitor internal energy by auditory. sphygmomanometers measure blood \npresssure changes by displacement of mercury, springs, or electronic\nmeans.
